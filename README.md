# hra-exemption-calculator

If you're a salaried individual, you can claim House Rent Allowance (HRA) to meet your rented accommodation-related expenses. Salaried individuals who live in a rented house can claim this exemption and bring down their taxes.HRA can be fully or partially exempt from tax. Our HRA exemption calculator will help you calculate what portion of the HRA you receive from your employer is exempt from tax and how much is taxable.

If you don't live in a rented accommodation but still get house rent allowance, the allowance will be fully taxable.

How much of my HRA is exempt from tax?
The entire HRA received is not always fully exempt from tax. The least of the following three will be taken to exempt from tax:

HRA received from your employer
Actual rent paid minus 10% of salary
50% of basic salary for those living in metro cities
40% of basic salary for those living in non-metro cities
